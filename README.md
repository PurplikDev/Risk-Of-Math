# Risk of Math
Repository for final school JavaScript project of 2022

## Basically, this is a Calculator.

But it's not any other Calculator! It's a Calculator for **Risk of Rain 2** Items and Stats.

Is it useful? No, because you can just get a mod that displays all this information in real time during the game!

But do I care? Also no.
